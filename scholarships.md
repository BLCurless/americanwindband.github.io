# The American Wind Band Scholarship Program

Itâ€™s solo competition season! The American Wind Band continues to inspire gifted young musicians with our 16th annual Scholarship Competition, with **$1,300** to be awarded to one high school soloist and **$900** to each of two 8th grade soloists.

We provide scholarships are provided to promote private music study or participation in music camps.

Please note that our new application format is now a two-step process:

- Applicants will provide sound recordings of their solos for the first round of the competition. Judges will only consider the quality of the recorded performance, not the quality of the media used.
- Based upon those recordings, the scholarship committee will select contestants to compete in the second round: a live audition.

The live audition will be held on Saturday, March 12, 2016, at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church, 4501 Main Street, Downers Grove, Illinois.

To be scholarship recipients, second round winners are required to perform at our concert at the Hinsdale South High School Auditorium, 7401 Clarendon Hills Road, Darien, Illinois on Sunday, April 24, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. Our dedicated and growing audience appreciates the inspiring performances of the young contestants, and the scholarship concert is a favorite of many band members.
