# Join the Band

![The flutes](/images/flutes.jpg "The flutes")

The American Wind Band has an inclusionary policy toward new members. If you play a band instrument and wish to join, we ask that you be at least a high school player in one of the top positions in your high school band or in college continuing to play in the college band. Most of our members have continued to play after college or have taken off for business or family reasons and have returned to music performance. Several members are professional musicians keeping up their skill; some are band directors.

If you'd like to join, please email us at [americanwindbandil@gmail.com](americanwindbandil@gmail.com). You will be invited to attend without audition to see what the band is all about. If you like the performance level and the schedule, you can keep on enjoying performances of great band music as a member of the American Wind Band.
